            <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p></p> Bitcoin is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp" target="_blank">cryptocurrency </a>, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges. <br>

            Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. <br>
            
            It has since become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as a payment system or are used as utility or security tokens in other blockchains and emerging financial technologies. <br>

            <h4>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</li>
                <li>Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.</li>
                <li>Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has gone through several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.</li>
                <li>As the earliest virtual currency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of other cryptocurrencies in its wake.</li>

            <h2>Understanding Bitcoin</h2>
            <p>In August 2008, the domain name <mark> Bitcoin.org</mark> was registered.
                 Today, at least, this domain is WhoisGuard Protected, meaning the identity of the person who registered it is not public information. <br> <br>
                
                In October 2008, a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto announced the Cryptography Mailing List at metzdowd.com: "I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party." This now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today. <br> <br>
                
                
                On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined—Block 0. This is also known as the "genesis block" and contains the text: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date, and maybe also as relevant political commentary. <br> <br>

                Bitcoin rewards are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769" target="_blank">halved</a>  every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block discovery down to 6.25 bitcoins. <br> <br>

                One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi. <br> <br>

                If necessary, and if the participating miners accept the change, Bitcoin could eventually be made divisible to even more decimal places. <br> <br>

                Bitcoin, as a form of currency, isn't too complicated to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. However, it becomes very complex when you try to understand how it works.

            <h2>Risks of investing in Bitcoin</h2>
            <p>Speculative investors have been drawn to Bitcoin after its rapid price appreciation in recent years. Bitcoin had a price of <span>$7,167.52</span>on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to <span>$28,984.98</span>. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of over $69,000 in November 2021—it then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000. <br> <br>
            Thus, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mediumofexchange.asp" target="_blank">medium of exchange</a>. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature means its purchase and use carry several inherent risks. For example, many investor alerts have been issued by the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>  (SEC),<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp" target="_blank"> the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA), and the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.asp" target="_blank"> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau </a> (CFPB) regarding Bitcoin investing.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Regulatory risk:</span> The lack of uniform regulations about Bitcoin (and other virtual currencies) raises questions over their longevity, liquidity, and universality.</li>
                <li><span>Security risk:</span>Most individuals who own and use Bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular online markets, known as cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin exchanges are entirely digital and—as with any virtual system—are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.</li>
                <li><span>Insurance risk:</span>Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not insured through the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sipc.asp" target="_blank"> Securities Investor Protection Corporation</a> (SIPC) or the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp" target="_blank">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC). Some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. In 2019, prime dealer and trading platform SFOX announced it would be able to offer Bitcoin investors with FDIC insurance, but only for the portion of transactions involving cash.</li>
                <li><span>Fraud risk:</span>Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity. For instance, in July 2013, the SEC brought legal action against an operator of a Bitcoin-related Ponzi scheme.</li>
                <li><span>Market risk:</span> As with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the value of the currency has seen wild swings in price over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events. According to the CFPB, the price of Bitcoin fell by 61% in a single day in 2013, while the one-day price drop record in 2014 was as big as 80%.</li>
